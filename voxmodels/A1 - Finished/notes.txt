Rules for finished models:

Palette, must be the same for all models, this does not "break" anything code wise, but keeps it consistent :)

names:
    Must be only lowercase letters/numbers and  underscore_
    Must not start with number

Blocks (and things placed like blocks) must be in a 16 x 16 x 16 model. No exceptions
"Multiblock" ideas must therefore be made from seperate sub models
